## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page


## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript


### What I learned

In this challenge I learned so many things, specially the importance of structuring and planning ahead from the very first steps of the markup.

I learned, by error, that having a good understanding of how elements should work on both devices will give you a good advantage throughout the process and will lead to time efficiency and cleaner markup, style and code.

### Continued development

I need to continue learning how to be more efficient and effective with my markup and code, because I stumbled with so many problems along the way, that in retrospective I could have avoided by being more organized.
